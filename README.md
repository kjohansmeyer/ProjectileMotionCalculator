# ProjectileMotionCalculator
Easy-to-use Python function to calculate and visualize trajectory for 2D projectile motion physics

Function parameters:
  v0 - initial velocity (meters per second)
  thetaD - angle of launch (degrees) measured from the horizontal, must be on interval [-90,90]
  initialHeight - initial height of launch (meters) [or "height of cliff"]
  
  Program plots the object's trajectory along with useful values at maximum
  height and point of impact.
